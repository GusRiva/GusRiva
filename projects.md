# What am I currently working on

### Middle High German short narrative
I am considering the ways in which distant reading techniques might be used to explore this rich textual tradition. I will be presenting my first attempt at the subject in [a conference next September](http://www.mcda.ugent.be/).

### [Open Medieval French (OpenMedFr)](https://github.com/OpenMedFr)
I've been working with [David Wrisley](https://djwrisley.com/) on this since the beginning of 2018. The goal is to create a good quality corpus of Medieval French literature converting critical editions in the public domain into text files with metadata. I really hope this project grows in the future, because it would be a great resource for Medieval Studies.

# Things I plan to do in the future

### Medieval Women's Debates over Clerics and Knights
If I receive funding, I would love to carry out this project. It would be critical analysis of all the medieval texts where two women argue about who is a better lover: a cleric or a knight. Hard to believe, but no one has ever attempted a comprehensive analysis of this genre. 

### Stylometry – Authorship attribution for medieval texts
I would like to test if stylometry has something to say about the authorship of *Die halbe Birne*, a Middle High German short story sometimes attributed to Konrad von Würzburg

# Past but not closed projects

### [Konrad von Würzburg – Digital](http://kvwdigital.000webhostapp.com/)
The digital edition of the short stories by Konrad von Würzburg (13th century) was part of my PhD dissertation. I created transcriptions and critical texts in XML-TEI format and also a visualization interphase.

### [Der arme Heinrich – Digital](http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/de/ahd/index.html)
A digital edition I created togerther with [Victor](https://usc-es.academia.edu/VMillet) housed at the Universitätsbibliothek Heidelberg. I was in charge of most of the TEI encoding. I learned a lot working on it and I really like the result (although we are still thinking about improving things). Collaborating with the staff at the Universitätsbibliothek was also a wonderfull experience.
