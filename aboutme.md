I am a medievalist and digital humanist from Buenos Aires, Argentina. As a medievalist, I've studied mostly German, French and Iberian literatures of the High Middle Ages, but I'm passionate about all things medieval. As a digital humanist, I've been working on digital scholarly editing and some other issues in Digital Humanities (stylometry, distant reading). For my PhD, I created a digital edition of [three Middle High German verse narratives from the 13th century](http://kvwdigital.000webhostapp.com/). 

I am interested in the ways technology affects society and individuals, and focus on how it alters our understanding of the past.

I am also a [boardgames aficionado](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/GusRiva).
