I am a medievalist and digital humanist from Argentina, living in many places. For my PhD I created a digital edition of [three Middle High German verse narratives from the 13th century](http://kvwdigital.000webhostapp.com/). I've been working on digital editing and other issues in digital humanities for some years now. 

I also like to play boardgames
