I am a medievalist and digital humanist from Buenos Aires, Argentina. I've been working on digital editing and other issues in Digital Humanities for some years now. For my PhD I created a digital edition of [three Middle High German verse narratives from the 13th century](http://kvwdigital.000webhostapp.com/). 

I am interested in the ways technology affects society and individuals, and focus on how it alters our understanding of the past.

I am also a [boardgames aficionado](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/GusRiva).
